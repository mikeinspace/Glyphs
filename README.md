A fungible token meta-protocol built on Counterparty and leveraging Stamps

## Backstory

It occurred to me (and many others) that Runes' OP_RETURN implementation seems very much like Counterparty. In fact, fungible tokens have been possible on Counterparty for the last decade. Even the segmented nature of Runes token namespaces is reminiscent of sub-assets on Counterparty. So while Runes does not really strike me as a new and novel approach to tokenization, what can't be ignored is that Runes, thanks to its Ordinals-adjacency, has quickly become the #1 fungible token protocol on Bitcoin.
